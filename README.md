# DIPLOMADO_2022
This is a list of songs. 

1. Angel
Hey now, call it a split, because you know that you will
Oh, oh, you bite your friends like chocolate
You said, we go where nobody know
With guns hidden under our petticoat
Oh, we're never gonna quit it
No, we're never gonna quit it, no

2. Cesar
Wake up (wake up)
Grab a brush and put a little make-up
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up (hide the scars to fade away the-)
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table?
Here you go create another fable, you wanted to
Grab a brush and put a little make-up, you wanted to
Hide the scars to fade away the shake-up, you wanted to
Why'd you leave the keys upon the table? You wanted to

3. Dorkas
Your way
I'm tryna understand these days
I need to know if you're feelin' it or I'm wastin' my time
Your way or mine
You spent every second with him, you're takin' what you're givin'
Your mother don't approve of the way that you've been livin'
She says he puts you through it, you shouldn't let him do it
And if there is a voice in your head, don't listen to it

4. Alex- 
Viento vuelve hacer como ayer (2 veces)
como aquellos días en que yo vivía
junto a mi bohío y la madre mia
como aquel entonces tan sólo era un niño
y en esa pobreza que feliz yo era
viento vuelve hacer como ayer para sentir el comienzo de mi vida,
el comienzo de mi historia
VIENTOOOOOOOO

3. Dorkas
Your way
I'm tryna understand these days
I need to know if you're feelin' it or I'm wastin' my time
Your way or mine
You spent every second with him, you're takin' what you're givin'
Your mother don't approve of the way that you've been livin'
She says he puts you through it, you shouldn't let him do it
And if there is a voice in your head, don't listen to it
